# 8-6 Integrate runner with CLI execution

[Back to task list](./tasks.md)

## Description

Connect the runner package to the CLI for module execution. This includes creating a runner instance, registering modules, and executing the selected modules with proper error handling.

## Requirements

1. Create runner instance using `runner.NewRunner()` or similar
2. Register all available modules with the runner
3. Determine which modules to execute:
   - If `--profile` is set, use modules from profile
   - If `--modules` is set, use parsed module list
   - If both are set, combine them (or handle appropriately)
4. Call `runner.RunModules()` with module names, config, and dry-run flag
5. Handle errors from runner execution
6. Log progress and results
7. Exit with appropriate code based on success/failure

## Implementation Plan

1. Create `executeModules(moduleNames []string, cfg *config.Config, dryRun bool) error` function in `main.go`
2. Create runner instance:
   - Import runner package
   - Create new runner (need to understand runner API)
3. Register modules:
   - Need to import all module packages
   - Register each module with runner
   - This might be done in a separate function or init
4. Execute modules:
   - Call `runner.RunModules(moduleNames, cfg, dryRun)`
   - Handle errors
5. Log execution start and completion
6. Call `executeModules()` from `runCommand()` after config and module selection
7. Handle the case where no modules are selected (show error or help)

## Verification

1. Runner is created successfully
2. Modules are registered correctly
3. Module execution works for valid modules
4. Errors from runner are handled and displayed
5. Execution progress is logged
6. Exit code reflects success/failure

## Test Plan

1. **Module execution**: Test with valid module list, verify execution
2. **Error handling**: Test with invalid module name, verify error
3. **Multiple modules**: Test with multiple modules, verify order
4. **Empty list**: Test with no modules, verify error or help
5. **Progress logging**: Verify execution progress is logged

## Files Modified

- `main.go` (updated)
