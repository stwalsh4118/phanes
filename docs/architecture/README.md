# Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural analysis, design decisions, and comparisons with other tools in the configuration management and provisioning space.

## Purpose

These documents serve as:

- **Design rationale**: Why Phanes makes certain architectural choices
- **Comparison analysis**: How Phanes compares to similar tools
- **Trade-off documentation**: What Phanes gains and loses with its design decisions
- **Future planning**: Recommendations for potential enhancements

## Documents

- **[comparison-with-configuration-tools.md](./comparison-with-configuration-tools.md)**: Deep analysis comparing Phanes to Ansible, Chef/Puppet, Terraform, and similar tools. Includes pros/cons, use case recommendations, and architectural trade-offs.

## Contributing

When adding new architectural documentation:

1. Use clear, descriptive filenames
2. Include date and purpose at the top
3. Provide concrete examples from the codebase
4. Document trade-offs, not just features
5. Link to relevant code when possible
